# Import tensorflow
# Import tensorboard
# Import keras tuner
# Import the various scikit learn modules required

# Define the different models
# UMAP
# SOM

# Define the hyperparameters to tune

# Define the callbacks
# Early stopping
# Tensorboard

# Consolidate the models into an array

# Loop over the array

# Tune each model

# Calculate the AUC and Confusion Matrix png and save it as an artifact to tensorboard
# Log the computation time for each
